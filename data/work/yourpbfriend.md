summary: 'I worked as a Web Developer and Digital Marketer for YourPbFriend from 2014-2016. During that time, I helped YourPbFriend.com become the fastest growing online Paintball retailer &mdash; peaking at #2 by sales in 2015-2016 &mdash; and the #1 choice for Paintball gear trade-ins. I aggressively focused on our competitive advantage in used Paintball markers. This took shape in SEO, an in-depth trade-in
web application, a robust used gun rating system, and delivery of high-quality product photos and videos. Our trade-in program is emulated by virtually every other online paintball
retailer today.'

## Shopify over BigCommerce

In 2014 &mdash; after analyzing the e-commerce platform options &mdash; we moved from BigCommerce to Shopify due to its larger third-party application marketplace. These enabled us to quickly add support for additional features with minimal development time. During my time with the company, I successfully developed and implemented the following new features:

-  Trade-In Web Application
-  Facebook Page Widget
-  Sales Rep Affiliate Selector
-  Customer Product Reviews System
-  Zopim Customer Live Chat
-  Facebook Like Buttons for Product Pages
-  YouTube Video Feed
-  Pre-Order and Custom Order Product Types
-  Live Search Suggestions
-  Holiday Website Themes
-  Product Labels from Product Tags
-  Related Product Recommendations
-  In-Cart Upsells
-  Product Schema/Structured Data

In order to implement these features, I had to customize our store theme to a high degree.

### YPBF Shopify Theme

As a starting place, I chose a theme that had support for large product catalogs, a responsive design, and sporty font faces. This allowed me to quickly get to feature additions and delivering on customer needs. My development and customization workflow involved the Shopify code editor at first, but eventually a local environment thanks to the [Shopify Theme Kit](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-kit).
