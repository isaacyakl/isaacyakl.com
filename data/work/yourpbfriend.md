summary: 'I was a Digital Marketer for YourPbFriend from 2014-2016. My team and I brought
YourPbFriend.com to the #2 online Paintball retailer by sales from 2015-2016.
We differentiated ourselves from the competition with an in-depth Paintball trade-in
program featuring a robust rating system, high-quality photos/videos, and 30-day
return policy. Our program is emulated by virtually every other online paintball
retailer today.'
