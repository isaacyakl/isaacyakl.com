summary: "This is my personal website, built using NextJS. It features my portfolio, blog, social media links, and web-based résumé. In creating this, I experimented with CSS relative viewport units (vw, vh) for sizing instead of using breakpoints. This reduced the number of layouts I needed to create to a single one, but it became difficult to find numbers that worked across all screen sizes. Despite this, I managed to pull it off and found the only real downside is the inability to use zoom in desktop browsers."

## Prototyping

Because I had not revised my personal website in years, I started generating ideas. I first came up with some concepts on paper before moving two of the best ideas to Figma, where I could test them with multiple screen sizes. Eventually, I moved forward with the second, more professional-looking one. Of course, the end result had some changes after testing and feedback.

I attempted to use viewport units to see if it was possible to make a website without breakpoints, and it seems I have succeeded. Let me know what you think.
