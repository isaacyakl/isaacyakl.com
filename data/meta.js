export const intro = "I am a self-taught web developer with 5 years of experience designing and developing e-commerce websites and web application user interfaces (UI). My work has demonstrated the ability to successfully identify and create competitive business solutions that produce measurable results (e.g. the #1 most-used Paintball trade-in web application of 2015-2016). Outside of software development, these solutions often involve knowledge of SEO, digital marketing, business management, and design principles. I believe high quality results are produced by team collaboration, integrity, and solutions that focus on user experience (UX), competitive differentiation, and a minimum viable product.";
